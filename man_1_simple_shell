.SH Simple Shell

This repository contains all the necessary files to run a Simple Shell with some of the most used commands (ls, pwd, echo, cat).This shell interface was created from the C programming language, it gives the user a prompt "Holy_Shell>"; when entering a command accepted by the shell, it will be executed in a child process.

.SH This Shell has the following characteristics:

    This program automatically displays a prompt for the user to enter a command to be executed.

    The command line will always end on a new line when the user presses ENTER.

    when a command finishes executing, the prompt will appear again on a new line.

    when the user types the exit command, the program will exit and display the original LINUX prompt again.

    the program will stop when the user types CTRL + D (end of file).

    This shell handles the command line as arguments or as paths.

    The user will not exit this shell by typing ^C (CTRL + C).

    If the user types the env command, it will print the current work environment.

    if the shell does not find any commands within the given path, it will print an error message.

    This shell does not support wildcards, pipes, or logical operators ( * , | , && , || ).

.SH known bugs:

    when the user types an argument that the shell does not accept as a command and then types the command exit, the shell will not effectively exit on the first try.
